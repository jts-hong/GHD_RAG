}","Subpart W of part 98 requires petroleum and natural gas facilities to report annual methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from equipment leaks and venting, and emissions of CO2, CH4, and nitrous oxide (N2O) from flaring, onshore production stationary and portable combustion emissions, and combustion emissions from stationary equipment involved in natural gas distribution. Facilities covered by this rule might also be required to report emissions under other subparts of the GHG Reporting Program, if applicable.  The GHG Reporting Program requires reporting of GHG emissions: CO2, CH4, nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated GHGs: hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and other fluorinated gases.  These gases are often expressed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (mtCO2e).",5,"The answer provides a comprehensive overview of the regulations and methods for reporting GHG emissions from oil and natural gas system facilities. It mentions that CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities are reported from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions. The emissions must be reported if they exceed 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent per year. Additionally, it outlines specific calculation methods for different types of equipment and emission sources, such as Equation W–14A and Equation W–14B for natural gas emissions, and Equation W–25 and Equation W–29D for wet seal oil degassing vents and reciprocating compressor venting, respectively. The text also specifies the use of default whole gas leaker emission factors for different components in gas and crude service, and the reporting of emissions from natural gas distribution systems by LDCs. Furthermore, the provided tables contain default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering, as well as default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and gathering.

The applicability tool only serves as a guide to determine those facilities that are clearly well below the reporting threshold, those clearly above, and those close to the threshold who will need to collect further data to make a proper determination.",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by providing information about the document's contents and what it does not explicitly mention regarding the EPA providing a tool to assist oil and natural gas system facilities in assessing their applicability under this rule.

While this information is relevant, it does not fully answer the question and may cause some confusion for the reader.",1057,
4,Do the facility definitions in this rule affect other EPA reporting requirements?,"The facility definitions in the rule affect other EPA reporting requirements by specifying the criteria for reporting greenhouse gas emissions at the facility level. The provided tables contain emission factors for different components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering facilities, as well as default average component counts for major equipment. These factors and counts are crucial for calculating and reporting greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the tables also include default total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing and transmission compression, which further impact EPA reporting requirements. The emission factors and component counts provided in the tables are essential for facilities to determine and report their greenhouse gas emissions accurately, thus affecting other EPA reporting requirements.","The facility definitions in the rule affect other EPA reporting requirements by specifying the criteria for reporting greenhouse gas emissions at the facility level, including the types of equipment and activities to be considered, the thresholds for reporting, and the requirements for different types of facilities such as electric power systems, onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering and boosting facilities, natural gas distribution, petroleum refineries, pulp and paper manufacturing, electrical equipment manufacturing, and livestock facilities.{

6,How is the petroleum and natural gas systems source category defined?,"The petroleum and natural gas systems source category is defined as including petroleum refineries, importers, exporters of petroleum products, and natural gas liquids fractionators. It also covers various processes and equipment at petroleum refineries, industrial waste landfills, municipal solid waste landfills, and offshore and onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. The category involves reporting specific emissions such as CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from different types of facilities and equipment. Additionally, it outlines the requirements for reporting GHG emissions from various source categories and the use of default whole gas population emission factors. The document provides detailed information on the types of facilities and equipment included in the source category and the specific emissions that need to be reported. The provided tables contain default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, and default total hydrocarbon emission factors for various processes and equipment related to onshore natural gas production and transmission. These tables provide specific numerical values and factors used in calculating emissions from different components and processes within the petroleum and natural gas systems source category.","The petroleum and natural gas systems source category includes petroleum refineries, importers, exporters of petroleum products, and natural gas liquids fractionators.

The terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator. The document also mentions the use of Equation W–32A, Equation W–17A, and Equation W–14A or Equation W–14B for calculating emissions from different equipment types or event types.{

}","Facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2e per year must report. The rule defines three different types of facilities. You must apply the 25,000 ton per year threshold separately to each facility to determine if that facility must report. • For the onshore petroleum and natural gas production industry segment, a facility is defined generally as all emission source types (see the table below) on a well pad or associated with a well pad that are under common ownership or control in a single hydrocarbon basin, as defined by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. • For natural gas distribution industry segment, a facility generally is defined as the collection of all pipelines, metering stations, and regulating stations that are operated by a single local distribution company. • For all other industry segments, use the facility definition in the General Provisions to part 98. Under this definition, a facility is defined generally as all sources for which emission calculation methods are provided in 40 CFR part 98 (including those in the table below) and that are located on a contiguous property and under common ownership or common control. See 40 CFR part 98, subparts A and W for the precise definition of each of the three “facility” types.",5,"The answer provides a comprehensive and accurate description of the facilities required to report under subpart W (oil and natural gas systems), including the reporting requirements and the use of specific calculation methods and equations.

8,What gases must be reported by oil and natural gas system facilities?,"Oil and natural gas system facilities are required to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions. The provided input includes various tables containing default emission factors for different components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. These tables provide emission factors for valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, pneumatic pumps, gathering pipelines, wellheads, separators, compressors, in-line heaters, dehydrators, and other equipment. The emission factors are specified for different regions such as Eastern U.S. and Western U.S. Additionally, the input also includes information about the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states. Furthermore, the input contains default emission factors for leaker emissions, total hydrocarbon emissions, population emission factors, and methane emissions for various equipment and services related to natural gas storage, transmission compression, LNG storage, and import/export equipment. These tables and data provide the necessary information about the gases that must be reported by oil and natural gas system facilities, along with the factors and components that contribute to these emissions.","The gases that must be reported by oil and natural gas system facilities include CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions. The facilities are required to report the information specified in the applicable paragraphs of the section, and the GHG emissions data for petroleum and natural gas emissions sources must be quality assured as specified.{
    ""result"": ""The provided input contains a mixture of LaTeX equations and text, but most of the equations are not standard mathematical expressions. Many of them are not clear or do not follow standard mathematical notation. It seems that the content includes various environmental regulations, emission factors, conversion factors, and other technical parameters related to reporting gases from oil and natural gas facilities. However, due to the non-standard nature of the equations and the lack of context, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive explanation of the LaTeX formulas.""

}","Under this rule, facilities will detect, as applicable, and calculate GHG emissions according to the specified quantification methods. See the table below for a summary of the calculation methodologies by source type. Where volumetric emissions are measured, mass emissions of CO2 and CH4 will be estimated based on the annual mole fraction and density of each GHG. • The engineering calculation methods use monitored process operating parameters and either software models, engineering calculations, or emission factors. • For emissions detection, the rule allows the use of optical gas imaging instruments, organic vapor analyzers (OVA), toxic vapor analyzers (TVA) and infrared laser beam illuminated instruments or acoustic leak detection instruments for accessible components. For inaccessible components, reporters must use an optical gas imaging instrument. • Direct measurement involves the use of the high-volume sampler; or calibrated bagging; or rotameters, turbine meters, or other meters, as appropriate, depending on the individual component for emissions measurement. • For the use of leaking factors, the relevant emission factors will be applied to leaking components determined by using an applicable instrument and applying leaking factors. For the use of population factors, the relevant emission factor will be applied to all components.",5,"The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of how to calculate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for subpart W (oil and natural gas systems) facilities.

}","No. EPA’s intention in posting subpart W calculation utilities is to provide facilities with a simple tool for estimating emissions when determining applicability.  Additionally, the tools include a guidance and source tab to document how emission estimates were calculated.  The utilities are only a guide to help facilities determine their subpart W applicability.  If you suspect a facility may exceed the annual 25,000 metric ton CO2e threshold, you should refer to the calculation methodologies in 98.233 to determine emissions.",1,"The answer completely lacks relevance to the question about unlocked subpart W screening spreadsheets from the applicability tool.

13,The applicability tool for Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas has an operating factor for associated gas venting from produced hydrocarbons. How does this operating factor correlate with the barrels of crude oil produced?,"The text provides detailed information about the calculation of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from different types of equipment and activities associated with petroleum and natural gas production. It also discusses the use of default whole gas population emission factors for estimating emissions from major equipment and components. However, it does not explicitly mention the operating factor for associated gas venting and its correlation with the barrels of crude oil produced. The tables provided include population emission factors for different components and materials, default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, and default whole gas leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering. These tables can be used to estimate emissions based on the number of components and the emission factors. However, the specific operating factor for associated gas venting and its correlation with the barrels of crude oil produced is not directly addressed in the given text.","The text provides detailed information about onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and transmission, as well as offshore production.

}","EPA has provided guidance on the operating factor in the Notes section, where it states, “This is defined as the fraction of time the process unit is operating in a calendar year.  For example, a 90% operating factor would be entered as 0.9 because the unit is in operation for 90% of the year.”",,,1,"The answer does not provide any information about the operating factor for associated gas venting and its correlation with the barrels of crude oil produced, which is the main focus of the question.

14,Where can I find the screening tool for onshore petroleum and natural gas production?,"The document provides guidance on where to find the screening tool for onshore petroleum and natural gas production. It mentions that the tool can be found by analyzing a representative sample of separator or non-separator equipment oil in each sub-basin category or county using an appropriate standard method published by a consensus-based standards organization. Additionally, the document outlines the calculation of the gas to oil ratio (GOR) and the production rate from gas wells, as well as the use of best available monitoring methods for measurement data for onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities. It also provides guidance on the calculation of annual CH4 and CO2 emissions from onshore production storage tanks and gathering and boosting systems, including the use of software programs for flashing emissions calculation. Furthermore, the document emphasizes the importance of quality assurance for GHG emissions data and specifies monitoring and QA/QC requirements for offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. The document also includes several tables providing default average component counts, population emission factors, and leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering and boosting equipment, which can be used for emissions estimation.","The screening tool for onshore petroleum and natural gas production can be found by analyzing a representative sample of separator or non-separator equipment oil in each sub-basin category or county using an appropriate standard method published by a consensus-based standards organization.

","EPA does not have sufficient data to characterize an average emissions factor for scrubber dump valve leakage through transmission storage tanks.  Therefore, the calculation tool does not have this source built in.

}","You are correct that on April 25, 2011, EPA finalized a rule extending the deadline for submission of a request to use BAMM until July 31, 2011 (76 FR 22825).  On June 27, 2011, a proposed rule was published in the Federal Register that would allow automatic use of BAMM for the entire 2011 reporting year for emissions sources covered under subpart W (Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems) without seeking approval from EPA (76 FR 37300).  The public comment period for the proposed rule will be open through July 27, 2011.  Given the timing necessary to consider public comment and finalize the rule, EPA will not be able to promulgate the final rule by July 31, 2011.  Please note that 40 CFR 98.234(f)(1) indicates that ""If the reporter anticipates the potential need for best available monitoring for sources for which they need to petition EPA and the situation is unresolved at the time of the deadline, reporters should submit written notice of this potential situation to EPA by the specified deadline for requests to be considered.""  EPA agrees that as of July 31, 2011, the circumstances surrounding the applicability of the deadline will be ""unresolved"" and that submitting a notification of intent would satisfy the rule requirements.",1,"The answer completely lacks relevance to the question about the proposed amendments to subpart W issued on June 20, 2011 and the existing deadline in the rule of July 31, 2011. The answer provides information about default whole gas emission factors and leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering equipment in both Eastern and Western U.S. locations, default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment, and the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states. However, there is no direct mention of the proposed amendments or the existing deadline, and therefore the answer is not relevant to the question.",1,"The answer does not directly address the question about the finalization of the proposed amendments to subpart W issued on June 20, 2011 before the existing deadline in the rule of July 31, 2011. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the answer is true or false without further information.",1,0.2,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question.

}","If the power take-off for operating the truck mounted workover rig is the truck wheel drive engine (i.e. a transmission option to transfer the truck wheel drive shaft to powering the rig generator or wench or other rig equipment) then yes, this workover rig arrangement is “self propelled.” and not required to be reported.  However, if the truck has a separate engine not connected to the drive wheels that powers the workover rig equipment, then it is “non-self propelled” and must be included in your report.",,,5,The answer logically follows from the information provided in the context. The context mentions that self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading activities are integral to onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering and boosting facilities. It also states that self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading should be included for reporting GHG emissions under Subpart W. The answer correctly summarizes this information and provides additional details about the calculation methods and emission factors mentioned in the context.,1,0.1460674157,1,The answer provides a clear and confident response to the question without any uncertainty.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides information on the calculation methods for deriving emissions from the data, default emission factors and component counts for major equipment. It also concludes that self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading should be included for reporting GHG emissions under Subpart W based on the provided information.",740,
23,How do I define a facility under subpart W? Are all industry segments included in one annual GHG report?,"A facility under subpart W is defined as any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on contiguous or adjacent properties under common ownership or control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. The definition varies for different industry segments, such as electric power system, onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering and boosting, natural gas distribution, and carbon dioxide production wells. Each industry segment has specific criteria for defining a facility. Not all industry segments are included in one annual GHG report, as each segment has its own reporting requirements. Additionally, the provided tables contain default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, as well as default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment. The tables provide specific emission factors and component counts for different regions, which can be used in calculating greenhouse gas emissions for reporting purposes.","A facility under subpart W is defined as any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on contiguous or adjacent properties under common ownership or control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas.

24,What emissions are reported for petroleum and natural gas systems facilities?,"The document provides information about annual CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from venting gas directly to the atmosphere, as well as emissions from production and transformation processes in petroleum and natural gas systems facilities. It mentions the use of continuous emission monitors (CEMS) to quantify CO2 mass emissions and the calculation methods for various emissions. Additionally, the document includes several tables with data related to emission factors for different components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, processing, transmission, storage, and distribution. These tables provide population emission factors, leaker emission factors, and population emission factors for various components and equipment. The emission factors are expressed in metric tons of each pollutant emitted and are specific to different services, material types, and equipment types. The provided information does not include direct equations or calculations for the specific emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from petroleum and natural gas systems facilities, but it does offer valuable data for understanding and estimating emissions from these facilities.","The document contains information about annual CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from venting gas directly to the atmosphere, as well as emissions from production and transformation processes.

27,What percentage of emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems are reported under the GHGRP?,"The document provides detailed information on the reporting requirements for emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering and boosting, and natural gas distribution facilities. It specifies that facilities must report emissions if specific emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year. It also outlines the calculation methods for CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from stationary or portable equipment at these facilities. The text also mentions the requirement to report emissions from offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, and provides guidance on reporting for different industry segments. However, the document does not explicitly state the percentage of emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems that are reported under the GHGRP. The document also includes several equations and explanations related to the calculation methods for emissions, such as the fuel-specific default CO2 emission factor, high heat value of the fuel, conversion factors, and annual emissions from natural gas combustion. Additionally, it provides tables with default emission factors for different components and equipment at onshore petroleum and natural gas facilities, as well as population and leaker emission factors for natural gas distribution and storage facilities.

}","EPA does not have an exact estimate of what percent of U.S. emissions are covered under petroleum and natural gas systems at this time.  The petroleum and natural gas systems source category (Subpart W) requires reporting from facilities above an emissions threshold of 25,000 metric tons CO2e.  It is difficult to quantify what net emissions occurr below the threshold.  In addition, facilities below the threshold may not be directly comparable to facilities over the emission threshold due to differences in the types of emission sources covered.  EPA will continue to analyze the emissions from reports as well as linking the information to the US GHG Inventory to identify what fraction of emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems are covered by the GHGRP.",1,"The answer completely lacks relevance to the question, which asks for the percentage of emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems that are reported under the GHGRP.

}",The definition of facility depends on each segment and the proximity of emission sources to one another.  Generally under the GHGRP a facility is all co-located emission sources that are commonly owned or operated (see the definition of “facility” in 40 CFR 98.6 for more details).,5,"The answer provides a comprehensive and accurate definition of a 'facility' for petroleum and natural gas systems as per EPA regulations. It also includes additional information on emission factors for different components and material types in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering, as well as default average component counts for major equipment in different regions. This information is directly relevant to the question and addresses all important aspects of the topic.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate definition of a 'facility' for petroleum and natural gas systems as per EPA regulations, including the conditions for equipment to be considered part of a single facility.

29,Did all petroleum and natural gas system facilities subject to the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program report to EPA?,"The document provides detailed definitions and criteria for onshore petroleum and natural gas facilities subject to reporting under the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. It outlines the specific equipment and operations that fall under the reporting requirements, such as gathering and boosting equipment, natural gas processing, and offshore petroleum and natural gas production. It also specifies the conditions under which facilities are considered as a single entity for reporting purposes. The document mentions the emission thresholds for reporting and the specific source types from which emissions need to be reported. Additionally, it outlines the requirements for reporting emissions from different equipment types and provides specific calculation methods for determining GHG emissions. Therefore, based on the information provided, not all petroleum and natural gas system facilities subject to the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program may have reported to the EPA, as the document indicates certain conditions and thresholds for reporting. The document also includes several calculation methods and tables providing default emission factors and average component counts for different equipment types in onshore petroleum and natural gas facilities, which further support the complexity and variability in reporting emissions to the EPA.","The document provides detailed definitions and criteria for onshore petroleum and natural gas facilities subject to reporting under the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program.

The reporting requirements for different types of facilities, such as onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering and boosting facilities, and offshore production facilities, are detailed. Additionally, it emphasizes the need to report GHG emissions associated with the products supplied by petroleum and natural gas suppliers. The document specifies Calculation Method 1 and Calculation Method 2 of § 98.233 for determining GHG emissions and provides specific information that must be reported for each method. It also details the reporting of emissions from different source types, such as equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions, and sets thresholds for reporting emissions based on the amount of CO2 equivalent emitted per year. Furthermore, it emphasizes the retention of laboratory reports, calculations, and worksheets used to estimate CO2 emissions. The document provides comprehensive guidance on the reporting and quality assurance of GHG emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems.","The document outlines the specific requirements and methodologies for reporting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems.

The document also mentions the need to report GHG emissions associated with the products supplied by petroleum and natural gas suppliers. It outlines specific calculation methods, such as Calculation Method 1 and Calculation Method 2 of § 98.233, for determining GHG emissions, and specifies the information that must be reported for each method. Additionally, it provides details on the reporting of emissions from different source types, such as equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions, and sets thresholds for reporting emissions based on the amount of CO2 equivalent emitted per year. The document also emphasizes the retention of laboratory reports, calculations, and worksheets used to estimate CO2 emissions. Overall, the document provides comprehensive guidance on the reporting and quality assurance of GHG emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems.{

Additionally, they must report emissions from the onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting industry segment only if emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year.

The document also provides default population emission factors and leaker emission factors for various components and equipment in different regions of the U.S. These factors can be used to estimate GHG emissions when continuous gas composition analyzers are not available. The provided tables contain information on emission factors for different components, such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and pumps, which can be used in emission calculations. Additionally, the document includes default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment, which can be used in conjunction with the emission factors to estimate emissions. The information provided in the tables can be utilized to determine the GHG mole fraction for emission calculations in the absence of a continuous gas composition analyzer.","When a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available, annual samples must be taken according to methods set forth in § 98.234(b) for determining the GHG mole fraction for emission calculations.{

Additionally, the text includes several tables related to emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, and boosting equipment, as well as population emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage. These tables contain emission factor values for various components and survey methods, which are used to calculate emissions. However, there is no specific mention of sites in south Louisiana or their location within state boundaries in lakes, bays, and bayous. Therefore, based on the provided information, it is not possible to directly determine whether such sites are considered to be seaward of the terrestrial border and thus offshore.","The text defines offshore as seaward of the terrestrial borders of the United States, including waters subject to the ebb and flow of the tide, as well as adjacent bays, lakes, or other normally standing waters, and extending to the outer boundaries of the jurisdiction and control of the United States under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.{

44,Are emissions from stationary sources of fuel combustion to be quantified and reported in accordance with the methodologies specified in 40 CFR Part 98 Subpart C and not as described in BOEMRE's GOADS instructions?,"The document mentioned several calculation methods and tables which explain how to quantify and report emissions from stationary sources of fuel combustion in accordance with the methodologies specified in 40 CFR Part 98 Subpart C. The equations provided in the text describe the calculation of fuel combustion, emission factors, conversion factors, natural gas usage, CO2 emissions, N2O emissions, and various factors and emissions related to aluminum and adipic acid production. Additionally, the tables provide specific emission factors for different components and materials used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, processing, transmission, and distribution. These tables are essential for understanding the specific requirements for reporting emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from each stationary combustion unit as per the regulations specified in the document.","The document specifies the requirements for reporting emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from each stationary combustion unit under subpart C of 40 CFR Part 98. It details the calculation methodologies for quantifying these emissions in metric tons and provides specific instructions for different types of fuel combustion sources. The document also outlines exceptions for certain facilities such as onshore petroleum and natural gas production, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, and natural gas distribution facilities. It further discusses the reporting of emissions from different types of combustion units, including the exclusion of carbon dioxide emissions from biomass combustion. Additionally, it mentions the conditions for facilities emitting 25,000 metric tons CO2e or more per year and provides guidance on reporting facility operating data or process information for GHG emission calculations. The document also addresses the calculation and reporting of emissions from flares and supplemental fuel burning associated with petrochemical process units.{

The document also provides tables with population emission factors for different components and equipment in Eastern and Western U.S., as well as default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment. Additionally, it includes default total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing plants, onshore natural gas transmission compression, and underground natural gas storage.

It also outlines the conditions for reporting emissions from combustion units using specific fuels and the calculation methodology for determining CO2 emissions. Based on the information provided, combustion equipment that triggered Subpart C reporting can be incorporated into Subpart W reporting for CY2011, with specific reporting requirements based on the type and capacity of the combustion units. The document also includes tables with default emission factors and component counts for different types of equipment, which can be used in the calculation methodology for determining emissions. However, the document does not explicitly provide a formula or equation for incorporating Subpart C reporting into Subpart W reporting.

61,Are geologic provinces 160 and 160A one basin or separate basins for the purposes of defining a facility for onshore petroleum and natural gas production?,"Geologic provinces 160 and 160A are considered one basin for the purposes of defining a facility for onshore petroleum and natural gas production. This is based on the definition of a basin as geologic provinces as defined by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) and the consideration that all onshore petroleum and natural gas production equipment associated with all wells in the basin would be considered one facility. The document also provides tables with default emission factors and average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, crude oil production equipment, and natural gas transmission compression. These tables can be used to calculate the emissions and component counts for the facilities in geologic provinces 160 and 160A, supporting the decision to consider them as one basin for facility definition.","Geologic provinces 160 and 160A are considered one basin for the purposes of defining a facility for onshore petroleum and natural gas production.

This is based on the definition of a basin as geologic provinces as defined by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) and the consideration that all onshore petroleum and natural gas production equipment associated with all wells in the basin would be considered one facility.,3,0.2533333333,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is perfectly coherent and provides a clear and concise explanation of the definition of a basin as geologic provinces as defined by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) and how it applies to the facility definition for onshore petroleum and natural gas production. The answer also mentions the availability of tables with default emission factors and average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, crude oil production equipment, and natural gas transmission compression, which can be used to calculate the emissions and component counts for the facilities in geologic provinces 160 and 160A.",866,
62,Why did EPA require that facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production report by basin?,"The EPA required that facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production report by basin in order to accurately track and monitor emissions from these facilities. This requirement is based on the understanding that emissions can vary by geographic location. By reporting emissions by basin, the EPA can implement more targeted and effective regulatory measures. This approach enables the EPA to better understand the environmental impact of onshore petroleum and natural gas production in different regions and to develop specific strategies for reducing emissions in each basin. The tables provided contain population emission factors and default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment, which can be used to calculate and track emissions by basin.","The EPA required that facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production report by basin in order to accurately track and monitor emissions from these facilities.

}","When the GHGRP requirements for onshore petroleum and natural gas production were proposed, EPA’s goal was to provide a facility definition that all producers could directly apply, and that would be both practical and cost-effective.  EPA sought public comment on a range of possible options for defining the facility that would report with respect to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, ranging from defining the facility at the individual well pad, to defining the facility at the field-level, to defining the facility at the basin-level.  Taking into account public comment, EPA finalized the definition of facility with respect to onshore petroleum and natural gas production using a basin-level approach because the operational boundaries and basin demarcations are clearly defined and are widely known, and the approach covered most emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production.",,,5,"The answer accurately explains that the EPA required reporting by basin in order to track and monitor emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, and to implement more targeted and effective regulatory measures. The answer also mentions that this approach enables the EPA to better understand the environmental impact of production in different regions and to develop specific strategies for reducing emissions in each basin. The provided tables contain information that can be used to calculate and track emissions by basin, which supports the answer's explanation.",4,0.3703703704,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer provides a clear and concise explanation of why the EPA required facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production to report by basin. The sentences flow well together and the answer is easy to understand. The answer also mentions the tables provided, which shows a good understanding of the context. Overall, the answer is perfectly coherent.",872,
63,"If a facility does not have a GOR value for a well, what options are available to facilities in order to determine GOR for associated gas venting and flaring?","When a facility does not have a GOR value for a well, there are several options available to determine GOR for associated gas venting and flaring. These options include using the GOR from a cluster of wells in the same sub-basin category, delaying the reporting of GOR data if wildcat wells and/or delineation wells are the only wells that can be used for the measurement, or using one of the specified procedures to determine GOR as outlined in the regulations. Additionally, the provided tables contain emission factors for various components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, processing, transmission, and storage.

65,How do I determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for my oil well operations to decide whether I need to report emissions from completions and workovers of oil wells with hydraulic fracturing?,"The text provides a comprehensive overview of the determination of the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for oil well operations and the associated reporting obligations. It explains that GOR is the ratio of the volume of gas to the volume of oil when depressurized to standard temperature and pressure. It also mentions the need to determine the average GOR, in standard cubic feet of gas per barrel of oil, for reporting emissions from completions and workovers of oil wells with hydraulic fracturing. The text outlines various scenarios for determining GOR, including cases where GOR cannot be directly determined from available data. Additionally, the text includes tables with population emission factors for different components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, and boosting, as well as default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment. These tables provide valuable information for calculating emissions and determining the GOR for reporting purposes.","The text provides detailed information about determining the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for oil well operations, including the calculation methodology and reporting requirements.

66,How should a gathering and boosting facility that previously reporting under Subpart C report in RY2016?,"In order to report in RY2016, the gathering and boosting facility that previously reported under Subpart C should follow the methods in § 98.233(z) to report the quantity of gas received in thousand standard cubic feet and the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment. They can use the provided equations and tables to calculate the emissions. The equations provide the necessary factors such as fuel-specific default CO2 emission factor, conversion factors, and high heat value of the fuel. The tables offer population emission factors for different components and material types, as well as default average component counts for major equipment in both Eastern and Western U.S. Additionally, the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states is provided for reference.","The gathering and boosting facility that previously reported under Subpart C should report in RY2016 by reporting the quantity of gas received by the facility in the calendar year, in thousand standard cubic feet. They must also report the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment that cannot move on roadways under its own power and drive train, and that is located at the facility. In addition, they must use the methods in § 98.233(z) and report the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from the equipment. It is also important for the facility to quality assure the GHG emissions data according to the applicable requirements and to retain records of CO2 in metric tons that is transferred to each subpart RR facility.{

It correctly mentions that the facility should report the quantity of gas received in thousand standard cubic feet and the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment. It also correctly mentions that the facility can use the provided equations and tables to calculate the emissions, and provides a brief explanation of what these equations and tables contain. Finally, it mentions the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states for reference.

67,How do I determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for my gathering pipelines?,"The document provides comprehensive guidance on how to determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for hydrocarbon production from oil and gas wells. It outlines the calculation methodologies, reporting requirements, and scenarios where GOR cannot be determined. Additionally, it mentions the average GOR values used in specific equations and the requirement to report GOR for specific well types. The document also covers the use of default compositions in the absence of well production oil and gas compositions. Furthermore, it includes information on heavy gas oils, NGL fractionators, LDCs, and odorized propane quantities. The document does not contain specific equations related to GOR determination, but it does provide tables with default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering pipelines, as well as default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and gathering and boosting equipment. These tables can be used in conjunction with relevant formulas to estimate GOR and GHG quantities for comparison to specific thresholds.","The document provides detailed information on how to determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for hydrocarbon production from oil and gas wells.

72,Under onshore natural gas processing where are vent emissions reported?,"Vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing are reported as CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions. The emissions can be calculated using the appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for compressor components in gas service and non-compressor components in gas service listed in the table 'Default Total Hydrocarbon Emission Factors for Onshore Natural Gas Processing'. Additionally, the vent emissions can also be calculated using the appropriate default whole gas population emission factors listed in the table 'Default Whole Gas Emission Factors for Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Production Facilities and Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Gathering and Boosting Facilities'. The tables provide specific emission factors for different components and services, such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and pneumatic pumps, which are used to calculate the vent emissions. Furthermore, the table 'Default Average Component Counts for Major Onshore Natural Gas Production Equipment and Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Gathering and Boosting Equipment' provides the average component counts for major equipment, which can be used in conjunction with the emission factors to calculate the total vent emissions. The document does not provide any specific equations or formulas for the calculation of vent emissions, but it outlines the emission factors and component counts required for the calculation.","Vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing are reported as CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions. The emissions can be calculated using the appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for compressor components in gas service and non-compressor components in gas service listed in Table W–2. Additionally, the vent emissions can also be calculated using the appropriate default whole gas population emission factors listed in Table W–1A of this subpart for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities.{

The natural gas processing plant includes compression equipment owned or operated by the plant, and the underground storage facility includes compression equipment connected to the wellheads. Therefore, if they share compression equipment, they can be considered as one facility. The provided tables contain emission factors, population emission factors, and leaker emission factors for various components and equipment in different regions. These factors can be used to calculate the emissions from the combined facility if the specific components and equipment are shared between the natural gas processing plant and the underground storage facility.","The natural gas processing plant and the underground storage facility can report as one combined facility if they share compression equipment.

It also mentions the specific equipment that needs to be shared for this to happen and provides information on the emission factors that can be used to calculate the emissions from the combined facility.,819,
75,"If fuel gas lines are not owned or operated by a gas processing facility, but are on the gas processing facility property, do the fuel gas lines need to be monitored for equipment leaks?","Based on the information provided, the fuel gas line containing only vapors from specific activities that are combusted in a thermal oxidizer or thermal incinerator does not need to be monitored for equipment leaks. This is because the text does not indicate any requirement for monitoring fuel gas lines in such a scenario. Additionally, the text does not mention any specific regulations or environmental terms related to the monitoring of fuel gas lines on the gas processing facility property. Therefore, based on the given information, there is no indication that the fuel gas lines need to be monitored for equipment leaks in the described situation.","The text mentions that the fuel gas line contains only vapors from specific activities that are combusted in a thermal oxidizer or thermal incinerator. It also states the annual average flow rate of fuel gas in the fuel gas line to the combustion unit, and provides a method for calculating the annual average flow rate using company records. Additionally, it discusses the use of stripping gas, common pipe configurations, and the reporting of GHG emissions from combustion units.

}","The Rule states in §98.230(a) that the onshore natural gas processing industry includes all plants that fractionate, as well as all plants that do not fractionate that have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater.  Only those non-fractionating facilities with an annual average throughput of less than 25 MMscf per day would not be subject to reporting under subpart W even if the reporting threshold is triggered in Subpart C.  The gas processing plant throughput threshold in 98.230(a)(3) is based on annual average throughput.",,,5,"The answer provides the exact information requested in the question, stating that the document provides information on the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids and have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater. It also mentions calculation methods for determining GHG mole fraction in feed natural gas and residue gas to transmission pipeline systems for onshore natural gas processing facilities. The answer goes on to mention that the document includes several tables with data on emission factors, component counts, and leaker emission factors for onshore natural gas production and gathering facilities, as well as total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing and transmission compression, which can be used to calculate emissions and determine compliance with environmental regulations.

79,What is the basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities in 98.230(a)(3) and how often must a facility re-evaluate whether it falls below this threshold?,"The basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities is that processing plants that fractionate gas liquids, and processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater are included in the onshore natural gas processing segment. The frequency for re-evaluating whether a facility falls below this threshold is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, the document provides emission factors and leaker emission factors for various components and equipment in onshore natural gas processing and transmission compression. These factors can be used to calculate emissions and assess whether a facility falls below the 25 MMscfd threshold. The emission factors can be used in conjunction with the average component counts for major equipment to estimate the total hydrocarbon emissions from the facility. Additionally, the document includes survey methods for determining leaker emission factors, which can be utilized in the re-evaluation process to ensure compliance with the threshold.","The basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities is that processing plants that fractionate gas liquids, and processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater are included in the onshore natural gas processing segment.

}","However, please note that if, in year 2, your throughput capacity is less than 25 MMscf per day, you are not required to calculate and report GHG emissions from gas processing in year 2.  You would still be required to report other covered emissions at your facility.  This is because gas processing would not be an applicable segment for year 2.  Nevertheless, your facility would still be required to report in year 2, even if facility-wide emissions are less than 25,000mt CO2e, and would continue to report until you meet the criteria in 98.2(i) for ceasing to report.  The gas processing plant throughput threshold in 98.230(a)(3) is based on annual average throughput.  This throughput is re-evaluated annually.  Once you are subject to the rule (e.g., your facility contains a source category listed in Table A-4), your facility must continue complying with all the requirements of this part, even if the facility does not meet the applicability requirements in a future year (i.e., 25,000 mtCO2e for petroleum and natural gas systems). The definition of the source category for petroleum and natural gas systems, under onshore natural gas processing, refers to a processing facility that does not fractionate and has a throughput of 25MMscf per day or greater.  Because a gas processing facility that is over 25 MMscf per day meets the definition of the source category for subpart W, any facility that becomes subject to the rule in whole or in part because of a natural gas processing facility, would have to continue reporting until it meets the conditions for cessation of reporting in 98.2(i).",4,"The answer provides the basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities and acknowledges that the frequency for re-evaluating whether a facility falls below this threshold is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. The answer also mentions the emission factors and leaker emission factors for various components and equipment in onshore natural gas processing and transmission compression, which can be used to calculate emissions and assess whether a facility falls below the 25 MMscfd threshold. Additionally, the answer mentions the survey methods for determining leaker emission factors, which can be utilized in the re-evaluation process to ensure compliance with the threshold.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities and acknowledges that the frequency for re-evaluating whether a facility falls below this threshold is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.

80,"Which takes precedence for determining the Subpart W applicability of a natural gas processing facility- the 25,000 MT CO2e threshold (under 98.2(a)(2)) or the 25 MMscf per day throughput (under 98.230(a)(3))?","The document specifies that if a conflict exists between a provision in subpart A and any other applicable subpart, the requirements of the applicable subpart shall take precedence. This means that when determining the Subpart W applicability of a natural gas processing facility, the specific requirements and provisions of Subpart W would take precedence over any conflicting provisions in other subparts. However, the document does not explicitly state which specific threshold takes precedence for determining the Subpart W applicability of a natural gas processing facility between the 25,000 MT CO2e threshold (under 98.2(a)(2)) and the 25 MMscf per day throughput (under 98.230(a)(3)). Therefore, based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine which threshold takes precedence without further clarification or additional information from the document.","The document specifies that if a conflict exists between a provision in subpart A and any other applicable subpart, the requirements of the applicable subpart shall take precedence. It also mentions specific requirements and provisions for facilities subject to subpart W, including the use of best engineering estimates for data collection and reporting. Additionally, it outlines the applicability requirements for different subparts, including the conditions under which a facility or supplier becomes subject to the rule and reporting requirements. However, it does not explicitly state which specific threshold takes precedence for determining the Subpart W applicability of a natural gas processing facility.{

}","Since the throughput of the facility was identified in the question as 30 MMscf per day throughput capacity, this exceeds the exclusion identified in the §98.230(a)(3) for processing facilities that do not fractionate.  Therefore, this facility falls under the onshore natural gas processing industry segment definition as defined in §98.230(a)(3) and these emissions would be included in the applicability determination for your facility.  (If the throughput were less than 25 MMscf this source would not have been considered in the applicability determination for the facility.)  However, based on the information provided, since the processing facility has less than 25,000 metric tons CO2e in combined emissions from stationary combustion, flaring, vented, and fugitive sources, the facility does not need to report under subpart W.  Both the 25,000 metric ton CO2e threshold (from §98.2(a)(2)) and the 25 MMscf per day annual average throughput (from §98.230(a)(3)) are considered when determining subpart W applicability for a natural gas processing facility.",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by stating that the specific requirements and provisions of Subpart W would take precedence over any conflicting provisions in other subparts.

81,May engineering calculations be used for flare gas composition in equations W-19 through W-21 if the flared stream is a combination of gases from before and after the demethanizer as well as hydrocarbon product?,"The document provides guidance on using gas composition analyzer data for calculating emissions from flare gas. It outlines methods for estimating flare gas composition using engineering calculations and process knowledge. Additionally, it discusses the calculation of fab-wide gas-specific heel factors and fab-specific emission factors for different gases. The document also details the calculation methodology for estimating CO2 emissions from NGL fractionators and LDCs. The content indicates that engineering calculations may be used for flare gas composition in equations W-19 through W-21, provided that the appropriate gas compositions for each stream of hydrocarbons going to the flare are determined. The document also includes several tables providing default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, average component counts for major crude oil production equipment, designation of Eastern and Western U.S., default whole gas leaker emission factors, default total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, and default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression. These tables contain valuable data that can be used in the engineering calculations for flare gas composition and emission factor estimation.","The document provides guidance on using gas composition analyzer data for calculating emissions from flare gas.

}","98.232 (d) states that “for onshore natural gas processing, report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from the following sources”.  For example, if the compressor stream is 100% propane then the emissions will not include CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions and therefore will not have to be reported under subpart W.  However, if the facility exceeds the 25,000 mtCO2e threshold then the owner or operator must report combustion emissions for this compressor under subpart C.",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by providing information on the document's coverage of GHG emissions in the natural gas industry, but it does not directly answer whether potential GHG emissions from compressors at a natural gas processing facility that are only used for refrigeration and use 100% propane are required to be calculated under subpart W.",5,The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question by stating that there is no specific mention of calculating potential GHG emissions from compressors at a natural gas processing facility that are only used for refrigeration and use 100% propane under subpart W.

85,What is the difference between the methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions?  How do we treat intermittent emission from the storage tank? Can we use an alternative method to quantify the emissions?,"The methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions differ in the type of monitoring required. 98.233(k) specifies the use of continuous emission monitors (CEMS) for quantifying CO2 mass emissions, while 98.234(a)(1) requires monitoring the tank vapor vent stack annually using specified methods. Intermittent emissions from the storage tank are addressed through the requirement for at least annual estimation of emissions. Alternative methods for quantifying emissions are allowed, such as monitoring changes in container weights and inventories or monitoring the mass flow of cover gases or carrier gases into the gas distribution system. The document provides detailed instructions on the calculation methods for deriving emissions, including the use of CEMS, monitoring equipment, and specific equations for calculating quantities of gases like CH4. It also outlines the frequency of measurement and sampling for estimating emissions based on monitoring equipment. Additionally, the document discusses the use of monitoring systems for CH4 liberated from degasification systems and ventilation systems, as well as the calculation and reporting requirements for CH4 emissions. Overall, the document offers flexibility in monitoring and quantifying emissions, while emphasizing the importance of following specific calculation methodologies and quality assurance procedures.","The methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions differ in the type of monitoring required. 98.233(k) specifies the use of continuous emission monitors (CEMS) for quantifying CO2 mass emissions, while 98.234(a)(1) requires monitoring the tank vapor vent stack annually using specified methods.

                    ""Population","The purpose of this detection and measurement is to determine and quantify any continuous gas emissions from condensate storage tanks.  The most common source of vapor emissions from a transmission compressor station condensate tank would be liquid transfer from compressor scrubber dump valves.  These sources operating properly would be intermittent transfer of liquids from high pressure vessels to an atmospheric storage tank, with a short term flashing of dissolved gas, which is assumed to be less than 5 minutes in duration.  Malfunction of scrubber dump valves can result in high pressure vapor leaking through the valve, into the condensate tank, and out the tank roof vent, which would vent indefinitely.  This continuous release of vapor is detected as a continuous blow of gas from the condensate tank roof vent using a leak imaging camera or by using an acoustic through-valve leak detection instrument.  Based on the current rule, when using an optical gas imaging instrument, the tank needs to be monitored to determine whether the tank vapors are continuous for 5 minutes; see section 98.233(k)(2).  So if a leak is detected per requirements of 98.234(a)(1) and is continuous per the requirements of 98.233(k)(2) then the reporter has to measure the emissions per requirements in 98.233(k)(2)(i)-(iv).  The reporter has the choice of using an acoustic leak detection device to detect and measure leaks per requirements in 98.234(a)(5).  You cannot use alternative methods to those outlined in the rule.",,,5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the difference between the methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions, as well as how intermittent emissions from the storage tank are addressed and what alternative methods are allowed for quantifying emissions. The answer also mentions the document's instructions on calculation methods, frequency of measurement and sampling, and the use of monitoring systems for CH4 emissions, which shows a thorough understanding of the context.",1,0.2428940568,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,4,"The answer provides a clear and concise explanation of the difference between the methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions. It also addresses how intermittent emissions from the storage tank are addressed and mentions alternative methods for quantifying emissions. The answer provides detailed instructions on the calculation methods for deriving emissions and outlines the frequency of measurement and sampling for estimating emissions based on monitoring equipment. Additionally, the answer discusses the use of monitoring systems for CH4 liberated from degasification systems and ventilation systems, as well as the calculation and reporting requirements for CH4 emissions. However, there are a few instances where the answer could be more coherent and flow better, hence the score of 4 stars.",1397,
86,"For transmission tank venting sent to the flare, the reporter is referred to the emissions source for flare stack emissions, but guidance is only provided for upstream production and gas processing in this section.","The text mentions that specific information must be reported if the vent stack vented to a flare during the calendar year. It also provides guidance on calculating CH4, CO2, and N2O annual emissions if emissions from compressor scrubber dump valve leakage are routed to a flare. Additionally, it outlines the calculation method for determining storage tank emissions sent to a flare using the calculation method of flare stacks in paragraph (n) of this section. The provided tables include default whole gas emission factors, default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, default total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression, default total hydrocarbon population emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression, and default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for underground natural gas storage. These tables contain emission factors and component counts for different equipment and materials, which can be used in the calculation method for determining storage tank emissions sent to a flare. The calculation method involves using the emission factors and component counts to estimate the emissions of CH4, CO2, and N2O from the storage tank venting sent to the flare. The specific calculation method can be derived from the provided emission factors and component counts, and it may involve multiplying the component counts by the emission factors and summing the products to obtain the total emissions. The document does not provide explicit equations, but the information in the tables can be used to derive the calculation method for the given scenario.","The text mentions that if the vent stack vented to a flare during the calendar year, specific information must be reported.

88,"The definition of the onshore natural gas transmission compression includes ""any stationary combustion of compressors that move natural gas at elevated pressure","The given text provides a comprehensive explanation of the onshore natural gas transmission compression and the associated environmental regulations. It defines onshore natural gas transmission compression as the stationary combination of compressors that move natural gas at elevated pressure from production fields, natural gas processing plants, or other transmission compressors through transmission pipelines to natural gas distribution pipelines, LNG storage facilities, or into underground storage. It also includes equipment for liquids separation and tanks for the storage of water and hydrocarbon liquids. The document mentions the reporting of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from various sources, as well as the use of default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for compressor components in gas service and non-compressor components in gas service. Additionally, it specifies the calculation of emissions from the onshore natural gas transmission pipeline industry segment only if emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year. The text also discusses the reporting of combustion-related emissions from stationary or portable equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, and natural gas distribution, and the use of appropriate default whole gas leaker factors for components in gas service in onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities. The provided tables include default whole gas emission factors, default average component counts, default whole gas leaker emission factors, default total hydrocarbon emission factors, and default total hydrocarbon population emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression. These tables provide detailed emission factors and counts for various components and services, along with different survey methods for calculating emissions. The information in the tables can be used to calculate emissions from onshore natural gas transmission compression facilities based on the specific components and survey methods used.","The onshore natural gas transmission compression is defined as any stationary combination of compressors that move natural gas at elevated pressure from production fields, natural gas processing plants, or other transmission compressors through transmission pipelines to natural gas distribution pipelines, LNG storage facilities, or into underground storage.

91,Are unintentional natural gas releases such as those resulting from accidental releases subject to reporting?,"The document clearly states that unintentional natural gas releases, such as those resulting from equipment blowdown for maintenance and direct venting of gas used to power equipment, are subject to reporting. It also provides specific calculation methods for reporting annual natural gas emissions from well venting and blowdown vent stack emissions. Additionally, it addresses the reporting of emissions from natural gas distribution and transmission pipeline industry segments based on specified emission thresholds. Therefore, unintentional natural gas releases are indeed subject to reporting as per the information provided in the document.","The document mentions that vented emissions of natural gas, including unintentional releases such as equipment blowdown for maintenance, and direct venting of gas used to power equipment, are subject to reporting. It also specifies that offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from vented emissions as identified in the data collection and emissions estimation study conducted by BOEMRE in compliance with 30 CFR 250.302 through 304. Additionally, it provides specific calculation methods for reporting annual natural gas emissions from well venting and blowdown vent stack emissions. The document also addresses the reporting of emissions from natural gas distribution and transmission pipeline industry segments based on specified emission thresholds. Overall, the content indicates that unintentional natural gas releases, such as those resulting from accidental releases, are indeed subject to reporting.{

The document includes requirements for monitoring and reporting emissions, as well as methods for calculating emissions from different sources. It mentions the use of continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) for estimating emissions and the need to retain laboratory reports, calculations, and worksheets used to estimate the CO2 emissions of petroleum products, natural gas liquids, biomass, and feedstocks reported. There are also specific reporting requirements for different industry segments, such as natural gas distribution, natural gas transmission pipeline, and offshore production facilities. The document emphasizes the importance of documenting methods used to determine representative points for conducting performance tests to report emissions. It also addresses the reporting of emissions from different sources, such as surface leakage, destruction device malfunctions, and fluorinated GHG products of incomplete combustion. Furthermore, it outlines requirements for reporting emissions from semiconductor manufacturing facilities and the reporting of N2O process emissions at the facility level. Lastly, it provides instructions for reporting CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emission source types for offshore petroleum and natural gas production. The document mentioned several calculation methods which explains how to derive the emission from the data. The equations provided in the document include formulas for calculating fuel, high heat value, CO2 emission factor, conversion factors, annual natural gas usage, annual CO2 mass emissions, N2O emission factor, N2O concentration, volumetric flow rate, production rate, number of test runs, annual N2O mass emissions, annual emissions of PFC compounds, emissions of individual PFC compounds, monthly CF4 emissions, slope coefficient, anode effect minutes, metal production, and overvoltage emission factor. Additionally, the document includes tables that provide emission factors for different components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering, default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, and default whole gas leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering.","The document provides guidelines for reporting emissions from various facilities in the petroleum and natural gas industry.

It also includes specific definitions for facility with respect to electric power systems, onshore petroleum and natural gas production, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, natural gas distribution, and carbon dioxide production wells. The definition also includes reporting requirements and specific information to be provided at the facility level. Additionally, the provided tables contain emission factors for various components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, and boosting, as well as default average component counts for major equipment in these processes. The tables also include designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states and default emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, transmission compression, and underground natural gas storage. These tables provide specific values and factors used in the calculation of emissions from different components and equipment, which are relevant to understanding the definition of 'facility' for underground storage in the context of environmental regulations.","The definition of 'facility' for underground storage includes any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas.

96,Why do natural gas storage facilities not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment.,"The natural gas storage facilities do not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment because the default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage stations or storage wellheads in gas service are provided as a single value for each component, regardless of whether they are compressor or non-compressor components. The emission factors are given based on the survey methods specified in § 98.234(a)(1) through (6) and Method 21 as specified in § 98.234(a)(7). These factors are not differentiated based on the specific operation of the components within the storage facilities, leading to a single emission factor for each component type.","The text provides detailed information about underground natural gas storage facilities, including the processes and operations involved, such as compression, dehydration, and flow measurement. It also mentions the use of default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage stations or storage wellheads in gas service. However, it does not explicitly address why natural gas storage facilities do not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment.{

The reporting is required for CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources. It involves using appropriate default emission factors for different components. The document also mentions the use of best engineering estimates for data collection during the initial 6 months of reporting for newly acquired sources or newly subject facilities. Additionally, it specifies the use of specific monitoring methods and calculation procedures for emission estimation. Therefore, reporting of emissions is required during the salt dome mining process to create an underground natural gas storage facility, and it is not limited to when natural gas is introduced for load balancing or storage.","Subpart W requires reporting of emissions from various sources related to petroleum and natural gas production facilities, including salt dome mining to create underground natural gas storage facilities.

}","EPA has acknowledged the error and is considering options to address this.  The entry in Table W-4, the second occurrence of the emission factor for Open-Ended Line with a value of 0.03 scf/hour/component should be included in the Population Emission Factors – Storage Wellheads, Gas Service section of Table W-4.",4,"The answer provides relevant information about the tables related to emission factors, component counts, and survey methods for different regions in the U.S. and different equipment types. It specifically mentions the emission factors for components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, and pressure relief valves, along with the corresponding counts for major equipment in different regions. The answer also correctly identifies the presence of 'Open-ended Line' in both the first and third sections of Subpart W Table W-4, and explains how the information presented in the tables can be used to calculate emissions based on the component counts and emission factors for the 'Open-ended Line' as required in Subpart W Table W-4.",1,"The provided answer does not logically follow from the given context. The context only provides information about the reporting requirements, methods, and provisions for facilities subject to Subpart W of the environmental regulations. It does not mention anything about Subpart W Table W-4 having four sections or any specific labels for those sections. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the answer is true or false without further information.",3,0.2233502538,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides relevant information about emission factors, component counts, and survey methods for different regions and equipment types. It also mentions the specific component 'Open-ended Line' and how the provided information can be used to calculate emissions as required in Subpart W Table W-4. However, the answer could be improved by directly addressing the question and explicitly stating that the first and third sections of Subpart W Table W-4 both have an entry for 'Open-ended Line'.",1128,

It also outlines reporting requirements for emissions from different source types and provides calculation methods for reporting greenhouse gas emissions from onshore production and gathering facilities, natural gas processing, LNG storage, onshore natural gas transmission compression, and underground natural gas storage.

It also mentions the absorbent circulation rate and the criteria for reporting information for dehydrators with different throughput levels. However, the text does not explicitly define 'underground natural gas storage facility' or directly address whether dehydration units used for natural gas extraction from underground storage are included within this definition. The provided tables contain default emission factors for various components in different services such as gas service, light crude service, heavy crude service, and gathering pipelines. These factors can be used to calculate emissions from different equipment including dehydrators.

It also outlines the requirements for reporting equipment components at facilities and the use of default emission factors for different equipment types. However, it does not explicitly specify whether only the equipment listed in Table W-5 (Vapor Recovery Compressor) is required to be reported if found to be leaking in gas service. The document contains tables with default emission factors for different equipment components and gas services, including leaker emission factors for LNG storage components. The emission factors are provided for different survey methods as specified in § 98.234(a)(1) through (6) and Method 21 as specified in § 98.234(a)(7). The emission factors are given in standard cubic feet per hour per component. The specific emission factors for LNG storage components in gas service are also provided, including valves, pump seals, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, meter and instrument, and other components. The emission factors vary depending on the survey method used. Additionally, the document includes population emission factors for LNG storage compressors in gas service, with a specific emission factor provided for the Vapor Recovery Compressor. Based on the information provided, it is evident that the document contains relevant data for determining the reporting requirements for leaking equipment in gas service, including LNG storage components.

}","LNG facilities will not be surveying the valves, connectors, and other components that are in Gas Service under 98.233(q).  At an LNG facility, a compressor that recovers vapor, but is designed so that it does not have reportable emissions of methane-containing gas, such as a flooded screw compressor, or one with seals purged with pressurized nitrogen, will not be reported, in accordance with the rule and the EPA’s response in Response to Public Comments, EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1026-7 (see pp. 45-46 in http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/documents/pdf/2010/Subpart-W_RTC_part1.pdf).  Vapor recovery compressors use a population emission factor, hence there is no leak detection required.  Reporters have to count the number of vapor recovery compressors and use the population emission factor.",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by providing relevant information about the document and its contents, including tables with default emission factors for different equipment components and gas services, and specific emission factors for LNG storage components in gas service. However, the answer does not directly address the question of whether only the equipment listed in Table W-5 is required to be reported if found to be leaking in gas service.",1,"The given text does not explicitly specify whether only the equipment listed in Table W-5 (Vapor Recovery Compressor) is required to be reported if found to be leaking in gas service. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the answer is true or false without further information.",2,0.27100271,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question. While the document provides detailed information about the equipment and facilities related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, it does not explicitly specify whether only the equipment listed in Table W-5 (Vapor Recovery Compressor) is required to be reported if found to be leaking in gas service. However, the document contains tables with default emission factors for different equipment components and gas services, including leaker emission factors for LNG storage components. The emission factors are provided for different survey methods as specified in § 98.234(a)(1) through (6) and Method 21 as specified in § 98.234(a)(7). The emission factors are given in standard cubic feet per hour per component. The specific emission factors for LNG storage components in gas service are also provided, including valves, pump seals, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, meter and instrument, and other components. The emission factors vary depending on the survey method used. Additionally, the document includes population emission factors for LNG storage compressors in gas service, with a specific emission factor provided for the Vapor Recovery Compressor. Based on the information provided, it is evident that the document contains relevant data for determining the reporting requirements for leaking equipment in gas service, including LNG storage components. However, the explicit requirement regarding reporting only the equipment listed in Table W-5 if found to be leaking in gas service is not directly addressed in the given text.",3,"The answer is partially coherent. It provides relevant information about the document's contents, including default emission factors for different equipment components and gas services, and population emission factors for LNG storage compressors in gas service.

A pressure relief valve is a special type of valve and falls in the category of ""other,"" so this emission source is included in the leak detection survey and required to be reported.  Regarding your first question: sections 98.232(g) and 98.232(h) do no include venting from LNG storage tanks as an emission source; therefore venting emissions from LNG storage tank are not required for LNG storage or for LNG import and export equipment.  However, if the LNG storge tank is blown down to atmosphere, then section 98.232(h) does require reporting.",5,"The answer provides a comprehensive and accurate summary of the document's content, including the calculation methods, equations, and tables provided for determining CH4 and CO2 emissions from various sources, including storage tanks and equipment.

","The LNG import and export terminal source category includes offshore equipment that receives imported LNG via ocean transport, stores LNG, re-gasifies LNG, and delivers re-gasified natural gas to a natural gas transmission or distribution system.  The floating vessels described above, not the ships, are considered LNG import terminal facilities.  Applicability would be determined by determining the estimated emissions and comparing against the threshold in 40 CFR 98.2(a)(2).",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by acknowledging that the document provides detailed information on the reporting of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, as well as the monitoring and QA/QC requirements for offshore facilities.

104,"Is an LNG Storage vessel considered ""above ground"" if any portion of the vessel is above grade?","The document mentions that an LNG storage vessel is considered 'above ground' if any portion of the vessel is above grade. Additionally, it provides detailed reporting requirements for LNG storage facilities, including the quantity of LNG added into storage and withdrawn from storage. The document also includes tables with emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering, as well as default methane leaker emission factors for LNG storage components. The emission factors table provides values for different components and survey methods, which can be used to calculate emissions. For example, the Default Methane Population Emission Factors for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Storage table includes an emission factor of 4.17 scf/hour/component for the Vapor Recovery Compressor 1. These tables and factors can be used to determine the emissions from LNG storage vessels and components, which can be essential for regulatory compliance and environmental impact assessment.","The LNG storage vessel is considered 'above ground' if any portion of the vessel is above grade, and the regulations provide detailed reporting requirements for LNG storage facilities, including the quantity of LNG added into storage and withdrawn from storage, as well as the use of appropriate default methane leaker emission factors for LNG storage components.{

It specifies the exclusion of customer meters and regulators, infrastructure, and pipelines delivering natural gas directly to major industrial users and farm taps upstream of the local distribution company inlet. Additionally, it outlines the calculation methods and emission factors to be used for reporting component emissions from equipment leak surveys conducted at above grade transmission-distribution transfer stations. The document also defines terms such as 'local distribution companies (LDCs)' and 'city gate' for clarity on reporting requirements.

}","For natural gas distribution, a facility, which is the collection of all distribution pipelines, metering stations, and regulating stations that are operated by an LDC, is required to do at least one facility wide leak detection survey per calendar year and has the option to conduct additional facility-wide leak detection surveys; if the facility selects this option, the additional facility-wide survey(s) must be completed during the same calendar year in order to account for fixing one or more leaks in the annual GHG report.  If the facility chooses to fix one or more leaks and conduct another survey to determine that the component is not leaking, it must conduct a facility wide leak detection survey in order to account for fixing the leak(s) in the annual GHG report.  As leaks are random in nature and while some leaks are fixed others are likely to occur.  Therefore, a comprehensive survey is the only statistically relevant manner by which to establish facility-wide leak emissions rates and account for leaks repaired.  Please see the response to comment EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1014-9 (Response to Comments, pp. 1281-1282, http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/documents/pdf/2010/Subpart-W_RTC_part2.pdf) for further details.  It is very important to note that the requirement to conduct additional facility-wide leak detection surveys should a company wish to account for fixing a leak does not preclude in any way a company from repairing a leak.  If a company chooses to conduct only one facility-wide leak detection survey in a calendar year but finds a leak during the survey, the company can and is encouraged to fix the leak.  The leak detected though, as noted above, must be reported as a leaker for the entire calendar year should the company choose not to conduct a second survey.",4,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation that at least one leak detection survey must be conducted in a calendar year, and that multiple surveys can be conducted. The answer also correctly states that the number of surveys does not need to be indicated in advance. Additionally, the answer mentions the specific requirements for equipment leak surveys and the option for natural gas distribution facilities to perform surveys across a multiple-year cycle. However, the answer does not provide any specific numerical values for the number of surveys to be conducted in a year.",5,The answer clearly states that at least one leak detection survey must be conducted in a calendar year and that the number of surveys to be conducted in a year does not need to be indicated in advance. This information is directly supported by the context.,2,0.3291139241,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides a clear explanation of the requirements for conducting leak detection surveys in a calendar year. It also mentions the specific reporting requirements for natural gas distribution facilities. However, it could have been more coherent if it had provided a numerical value for the number of surveys to be conducted in a year.",1040,
111,What happens if an LDC goes out to a custody transfer city gate station year after year and finds that it has no leaking components?  Could EPA provide a sunset provision so that annual leak surveys would no longer be required?,"The document outlines the requirements for conducting leak detection surveys at natural gas distribution facilities, including the frequency of surveys, methods for conducting surveys, and calculation of equipment leak emissions. It specifies that at least one leak detection survey must be conducted in a calendar year, and multiple complete surveys in a year must be used when calculating emissions. It also mentions the option for natural gas distribution facilities to conduct equipment leak surveys across a multiple-year cycle, and the reporting of the number of years in the leak survey cycle. The document provides details on the types of components subject to the surveys, the methods for conducting surveys, and the calculation of emissions. It also discusses the calculation of the emission factor based on annual equipment leak surveys at above-grade transmission-distribution transfer stations. Additionally, it outlines the requirements for monitoring CO2 surface leakage, the identification of potential leakage pathways, and the frequency of measurement and sampling. The document also mentions the use of specific approaches in EPA protocol for equipment leak emission estimates, such as the Screening Ranges Approach and the Unit-Specific Correlation Approach, along with the requirement to report the annual mass of CO2 emitted by surface leakage. The document does not explicitly mention a sunset provision for annual leak surveys to no longer be required if no leaking components are found year after year.","The document outlines the requirements for conducting leak detection surveys at natural gas distribution facilities, including the frequency of surveys, methods for conducting surveys, and calculation of equipment leak emissions.

The document primarily focuses on the requirements for GHG Monitoring Plans, delineation of monitoring areas, revision of the monitoring plan, annual monitoring reports, and MRV plan for monitoring, reporting, and verification of geologic sequestration. It also discusses the use of best available monitoring methods and the documentation requirements for the monitoring plan. Additionally, the document provides various equations and explanations related to emission factors, conversion factors, and emission calculation factors for different components and services in the petroleum and natural gas production facilities, gathering and boosting equipment, and crude oil production equipment. Furthermore, it includes tables with default whole gas emission factors, average component counts, and designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states. The tables also provide information on default whole gas leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, and total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression, including survey methods and emission factors for different components under different survey methods.","The document outlines the requirements for GHG Monitoring Plans as described in § 98.3(g)(5), including the completion deadline of April 1, 2011. It also specifies the need for a delineation of the maximum monitoring area and the active monitoring areas, with the length of each monitoring period being greater than 1 year. The owner or operator is required to revise the GHG Monitoring Plan as needed to reflect changes in production processes and monitoring instrumentation. Additionally, it mentions the need for an annual monitoring report and the contents of the MRV plan for monitoring, reporting, and verification of geologic sequestration. The document also discusses the use of best available monitoring methods and the documentation requirements for the monitoring plan.

}","As noted in the preamble, the purpose of this provision was to reduce burden for reporters, including the option to better align survey frequencies between the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program and Department of Transportation regulations.  The statement in the preamble regarding a “minimum of 20 percent of their total number of stations being leak surveyed annually” was considered for cases where a facility chose a period of less than 5 years. We also recognize that there is a related comment and response in, “Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule: EPA's Response to Public Comments: “2011 Technical Revisions to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems Category of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule” (see DCN: EPA-HQ-OAR-2011-0512-0030) where EPA may also appear to reject the 10%-10%-40%-20%-20% approach outlined above.  However, EPA understood the commenter’s recommendation as to be suggesting measurement of 10% of stations per year, over a ten year period. EPA’s objection to the comment to monitor 10% of stations per year would have been inconsistent with a five-year cycle.  Yes.   According to 98.233(q)(8)(i), “Natural gas distribution facilities may choose to conduct leak detection at T-D transfer stations over multiple years, not exceeding a five year period to cover all T-D transfer stations.  If the facility chooses to use the multiple year option, then the number of T-D transfer stations monitored in each year should be approximately equal across all years in the cycle without monitoring the same station twice during the multiple year survey.”  EPA confirms that an approach of conducting monitoring at 10% of the facilities in each of the first two years, followed by 40%, 20% and 20% in years three, four and five would be consistent with the rule language that the number of stations monitored be “approximately equal” over the number of years surveyed.",3,"The answer acknowledges that the document does not explicitly mention monitoring percentages for each year, but it provides information on the requirements for GHG Monitoring Plans, delineation of monitoring areas, revision of the monitoring plan, annual monitoring reports, and MRV plan for monitoring, reporting, and verification of geologic sequestration. It also discusses the use of best available monitoring methods and the documentation requirements for the monitoring plan. Therefore, the answer is partially relevant to the question.",1,"The document does not explicitly mention monitoring percentages for each year, so it is not possible to determine whether a monitoring plan resulting in 10% of stations being monitored in each of years 1 and 2, 40% in year 3, 20% in year 4, and 20% in year five would be consistent with the rule language of 'approximately equal across all years in the cycle.' Therefore, the answer falls under the category of 'an integer score between 1 and 5 if such integer score does not exist, use 1: It is not possible to determine whether the ANSWER is true or false without further information.'",1,0.3018867925,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,3,"The document does not provide any specific mention of monitoring percentages for each year, so it is not possible to determine whether a monitoring plan resulting in 10% of stations being monitored in each of years 1 and 2, 40% in year 3, 20% in year 4, and 20% in year five would be consistent with the rule language of 'approximately equal across all years in the cycle.' Therefore, the answer is partially coherent as it provides relevant information about the document's focus on GHG Monitoring Plans, delineation of monitoring areas, revision of the monitoring plan, annual monitoring reports, and MRV plan for monitoring, reporting, and verification of geologic sequestration. It also mentions the use of best available monitoring methods and the documentation requirements for the monitoring plan. Additionally, it provides various equations and explanations related to emission factors, conversion factors, and emission calculation factors for different components and services in the petroleum and natural gas production facilities, gathering and boosting equipment, and crude oil production equipment. Furthermore, it includes tables with default whole gas emission factors, average component counts, and designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states. The tables also provide information on default whole gas leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, and total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression, including survey methods and emission factors for different components under different survey methods.",1557,
113,What types of instruments are permissible for use in detecting equipment leaks and through valve leakage in Subpart W?,"The document specifies that the permissible instruments for detecting equipment leaks and through valve leakage in Subpart W include acoustic leak detection devices and infrared laser beam illuminated instruments. The acoustic leak detection device is used to quantify through-valve leakage, with a leak detected if a leak of 3.1 scf per hour or greater is calculated. Additionally, the use of Method 21 for equipment leak detection is mentioned, with a leak detected if an instrument reading of 10,000 ppm or greater is measured. The document also mentions the use of alternative leak detection devices if the equipment leak detection methods in the paragraph cannot be used. The emission factors for different components and survey methods are also provided in tables W-1A and W-1E, which can be used for further analysis and calculations.","The permissible instruments for detecting equipment leaks and through valve leakage in Subpart W include acoustic leak detection devices and infrared laser beam illuminated instruments.

It also outlines the default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment. These factors and counts can be used in conjunction with the specific leak detection methods for fugitive emissions components to estimate fugitive greenhouse gas emissions under §98.233(q). Additionally, the document discusses the use of continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) to monitor and estimate emissions, including CO2 mass emissions, which can also be relevant for estimating fugitive greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, data from a state permit-required fugitive emissions monitoring program with a lower leak detection rate of 500 ppm can be used in combination with the information provided in the document to estimate fugitive greenhouse gas emissions under §98.233(q).","The document provides information about the use of continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) to monitor and estimate emissions, including CO2 mass emissions. It also discusses the use of best available monitoring methods for estimating emissions, as well as specific leak detection methods for fugitive emissions components at well sites and compressor stations. The document outlines the requirements for monitoring and reporting CO2 emissions, and provides details on the monitoring and QA/QC requirements for fuel flow meters, gas composition monitors, and heating value monitors associated with CEMS. Additionally, it mentions the calculation methodologies for CO2 emissions and the conditions under which reporting of emissions can be discontinued.{

It also correctly states that the facility still needs to calculate emissions pursuant to Section 98.233(d)(11) and then 'reduce' the emission to zero, as specified in Section 98.233(d)(11). The answer also demonstrates an understanding of the provided equations, explanations, and tables, which can be used to calculate and estimate emissions from different processes and equipment, aligning with the requirement to calculate emissions pursuant to Section 98.233(d)(11) and then 'reduce' the emission to zero.",2,0.3519313305,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is well-structured and coherent. It provides a clear explanation of the requirement to calculate emissions pursuant to Section 98.233(d)(11) and then 'reduce' the emission to zero, and how the provided equations, explanations, and tables can be used to estimate emissions from different processes and equipment. The answer is easy to follow and sounds natural as a whole.",1045,
120,Can facilities performing on-site acid gas injection estimate their emissions downward according to the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility?,"The document mentioned various emission factors and population emission factors for different components and equipment used in natural gas production, gathering, boosting, processing, transmission, and storage. It also provided default average component counts for major equipment and the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. However, it did not specifically address the estimation of emissions downward according to the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility.","The document provides information about the calculation of emissions for CO2 from acid gas removal (AGR) vents, as well as the injection of carbon dioxide for enhanced oil and natural gas recovery. It also mentions the acid gas content of feed natural gas and outlet natural gas, and the geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide. However, it does not specifically address the estimation of emissions downward according to the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility.{

It also mentions that the compressor must be measured at least once in any three consecutive calendar years, provided the measurement can be taken during a scheduled shutdown. If there is no scheduled shutdown within three consecutive calendar years, the measurement must be taken at the next scheduled depressurized shutdown. Additionally, it outlines methods for performing as found measurements from individual centrifugal and reciprocating compressor sources.

","Facilities approved to use BAMM are still required to use the calculation methodologies and equations in § 98.233, and must comply with the reporting requirements in § 98.236.  The totality of the circumstances related to conducting measurement on compressors vents routed to a common manifold, if fully explained in a proper Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) request, may be considered by EPA to constitute unique or unusual circumstances justifying the use of BAMM. Pursuant to a May 2013 final rule, Subpart W BAMM requests are due by June 30 of the year prior to the year in which reports are due (the “reporting year”) and for which BAMM is sought.

127,Will EPA approve the use of Subpart W Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) relating to the measurement of compressor vents routed to flare?,"The document provides detailed guidance on monitoring and calculating emissions from compressor sources, particularly when routed to a flare. It outlines specific methods for conducting volumetric emission measurements for centrifugal and reciprocating compressor sources, including the calculation of volumetric GHG emissions from these sources when routed to a flare. Additionally, it specifies the calculation methodologies and equations for calculating GHG emissions when best available monitoring methods are used. The document also includes various tables providing default emission factors, average component counts, and population emission factors for different equipment and services related to natural gas transmission and production facilities. These tables can be used to calculate emissions and determine compliance with environmental regulations. The equations and explanations provided in the document can be used to derive emissions from the data, including the conversion factors, molar volume conversion factor, molecular weight ratios, and emission factors for different components.","The document mentions the use of best available monitoring methods for measurement data for natural gas transmission pipelines, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering facilities, and well-related measurement data for oil wells with hydraulic fracturing. It also provides specific methods for conducting volumetric emission measurements for centrifugal and reciprocating compressor sources, including the calculation of volumetric GHG emissions from these sources when routed to a flare. The document also outlines the requirements for conducting monitoring and QA/QC for flares and provides calculation methods for CO2 emissions from flare stack. It further specifies the calculation methodologies and equations for calculating GHG emissions when best available monitoring methods are used. Additionally, it mentions the use of continuous volumetric emission measurements for calculating annual volumetric GHG emissions associated with compressor sources. Overall, the document provides detailed guidance on monitoring and calculating emissions from compressor sources, particularly when routed to a flare.{

The document does not mention specific numbers that are key to answering the question. However, it provides tables with emission factors for various components and equipment used in natural gas production and processing, which could be used in conjunction with specific calculations to determine the emissions from dehydrators. The tables include emission factors for valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and other components, which could be relevant to assessing the environmental impact of dehydrators.","The document provides a detailed definition of a dehydrator, including the types of absorbents used, the process of removing water from natural gas, and the emissions associated with dehydrator vents.
